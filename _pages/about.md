 My name is Isaac Ahouma. I recently obtained my Master of Science in Machine Learning from the University of Montréal and the [Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA)](https://mila.quebec/en/). Before that I received a Bachelor in Computer Science from The University of British Columbia and a Honours Bachelor in Operations Research from York University. I am a continual learner and enjoy working on personal projects involving software engineering, python, data science or machine learning.

My goal with this blog is to help vulgarize technology, machine learning in particular, to underrepresented communities and to make new connections with like minded folks. I am very interested in using machine learning for good and for social entrepreneurship.
