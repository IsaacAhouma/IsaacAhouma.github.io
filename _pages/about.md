 My name is Isaac Ahouma. I obtained my Master in Deep Learning from the University of Montréal and the Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). Before that I received a Bachelor in Computer Science from The University of British Columbia and another in Operations Research from York University. I have a profound interest in applied mathematics, technology, machine learning, deep learning, and recently data visualization. I am a continual learner and enjoy working on personal projects involving one or more of the mentioned topics.

My goal with this blog is to help vulgarize technology, machine learning in particular, to underrepresented communities and to make new connections. I am very interested in using machine learning for good and for social entrepreneurship.
